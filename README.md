# üéÆ SnakC (SDL) üêç

## Overview
This is a **classic Snake game** implemented in **C using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library**. The project focuses on mastering SDL fundamentals while creating a fun, interactive and nostalgic game.

## Current Features
- **SDL Integration**: Successfully integrated and learned how SDL works.
- **Grid Rendering**: A structured grid where the snake moves.
- **Snake Rendering**: The snake is visually represented and animated on the screen.
- **Snake Growth**: Implemented functionality to increase the snake's size upon eating an apple.
- **Movement System**: The snake moves in a smooth and controlled manner.
- **Boundary Handling**: The snake no longer moves outside the grid.
- **Game Reset on Loss**: When the snake crashes, the game resets, and the score is lost.
- **Apple & Scoring System**: Apples appear randomly, and eating them increases the score.
- **High Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the highest score achieved.
- **Game Over & Pause**: The game pauses upon crashing, allowing the player to restart.
- **Snake Color Customization**: Players can change the snake's color.

## Installation & Usage
1. Install **SDL2** on your system.
2. Connect SDL to the your files as installing packages in C tends to be quite difficult.
3. Change the resolution of the Grid in which the game is running in based on the resolution of your screen.
4. Compile the game using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
5. Run the executable and enjoy playing Snake!
