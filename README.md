What does the project have until now: 

-We got a hold of how SDL works 
-We render a grid where in witch the snake should play around
-We rendered the snake
-We managed to make a function to make the snake larger
-We managed to make the snake move

We have to:

-Make the snake not get out of the grid
-lose if we try to head bumb the snake
-make the apple and maybe score
