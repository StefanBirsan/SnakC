## What the Project Has Until Now:

- We got a hold of how SDL works
- We render a grid where the snake should play around
- We rendered the snake
- We managed to make a function to make the snake larger
- We managed to make the snake move
- The snake no longer gets out of the grid
- We regeneate the snake if we lose and lose our score
- We have a score and a apple

## To Do:

- Highscore 
- Menu
- Pause
